1. False. Hue conveys a category, not a magnitude.
2. False. I think there is a substantial chance that two people will have the same first and last name.
3. False. If there is one attribute, then a distribution can be made by the frequency of that attribute in the items.
4. False. A zero point in the middle is only useful if the data is diverging from a center.
5. True. data can be season to season (cyclic) and year - month - day (hierarchical)
6. True if shapes is an attribute in the table.
7. True. A scatter plot is the canonical example of comparing two quantitative variables.
8. False. Position on a common scale is the most accurately perceived channel.
9. False. If the regions are small and scattered then more bins can be used.
10. True - size affects colors
11. False, perceptual system does everything through relative not absolute.
12. True. The user can see position on a common scale at different points in time.
13. True. Reordering is usually necessary to make groups of the data more clear.
14. True. The radial symmetry of the circle is useful for cyclic data because you can easily compare different points in the same part of the cycle.
15. True. The user may mistake area as important in terms of population, but a huge area may not represent many people.
16. True. The reader can easily tell the colors apart.
17. False. Continuous rainbow colormaps are actually perceptually unordered.
18. False. Bivariate colormaps are often misinterpreted because of cognitive load if there are many levels and many hues.
19. True. Encoding luminance lets us see edges which are the most important for understanding an image
