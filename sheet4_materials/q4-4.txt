What type of view coordination is used (single view, multiform, small multiples, overview/detail multiform,
overview/detail same form)? Justify your choice very briefly in terms of whether the visual encoding is
same or different, and whether data is shared between views or subsetted.

For each kind of mark used, state the mark type and which channels are used to encode what attribute on
that mark.

A:
    view coordination type is small multiples view because the visual encoding is spatial of the US for both levels and the data is unique
    marks: choropleth maps of the US. channels: spatial for where in high level the map is - which state it corresponds to - and color saturation encoding that state's out-migrants

B:
    view coordination type is multiform because the visual encoding is different - map vs bar chart - but the underlying data is the same - distribution of what % of statistics are claimed to be made up.
    marks: circles for map and lines for bar chart. channels: color and size both encode the % of statistics claimed to be made up (redundant channel) and length encodes the number of tweets claiming a specific percentage.
