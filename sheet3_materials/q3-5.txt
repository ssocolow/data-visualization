A: difficult to compare countries in terms of type of water usage because humans are bad at comparing areas

B: Information is too dense at the bottom of the y-axis, because smaller countries are squashed there. Area no longer means anything because x-axis normalized.

C: harder to tell per capita water usage Redundant information because of course water usage amount will be correlated with population
